# Machine learning UFC fighter model

This is a project that trains a machine learning model based on data taken via a ETL for ufc fighters. This model predicts which fighter won given 2 fighters as well as the time taken, round and method of KO for the predicted result. The project utilises pandas for preprocessing and cleaning the data. The project also utilises scikit learn to use various models such as random forest in my case. 

This project is a extension of the ETL i created and to run this project you must have a azure database with ufc fighter data.
